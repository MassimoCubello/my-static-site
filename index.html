            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a vital language for creating web pages. It provides the basic structure of any webpage (think of the skeleton's role in the human body), which is later enhanced and modified by other languages like CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>HTML allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add headings, paragraphs, and links</li>
                <li>Organize content into sections and lists</li>
                <li>Create forms for users to input data</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to make websites look a certain way, adding visual flair to the finished product and surrounds the copy that's been written in the HTML file.</p>
            <p>CSS allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design the layout of a webpage</li>
                <li>Change colors and fonts</li>
                <li>Utilize flexbox to organize content</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is the language that allows users to interact with a website. It lets developers build logic and systems into any given web page, making them respond to user input.</p>
            <p>JavaScript allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create unique elements and rulesets</li>
                <li>Complement HTML and CSS files</li>
                <li>Build complex web applications</li>
            </ul>
